![killer](/images/homicide.jpg)

## What issues or questions are you addressing?

Within our analyses and visualisations we want to answer the following research questions:
- What classifies as homicide?
- Are homicides a major cause of death?
- How do homicide counts vary (time/place)?
- Can homicide rates be predicted?
- Does victim gender play a role?


## What is the source of the data you will be using? 

We have used the following datasources for our analysis:
- UN Homicide Data: https://dataunodc.un.org/dp-intentional-homicide-victims
- IHME Homicide Data: https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/
- Global Change Data Lab Homicide Data: https://ourworldindata.org/homicides
- Happiness Indicators: https://worldhappiness.report/archive/
- Development Indicators: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators
- 

## What statistical techniques do you think you may be using?

It will be a difficult task to predict homicide rates as the factors within each country are so peculiar. However, a multiple linear regression model be utilized to understand the predictory value that the happiness score and other development indicators have on the homicide rate. A parameter selection optimizer will be used and variables log transformed if appropriate.
